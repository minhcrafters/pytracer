TODO:
- [x] cones
- [ ] write more tests

OPTIMIZATION TASK:
- [x] Profile the current ray tracer to identify bottlenecks
- [x] Implement NumPy optimizations for vector/matrix math
- [x] Enhance bounding boxes for better scene optimization (implemented)
- [x] Implement parallel rendering using multiprocessing
- [ ] Optimize recursive ray tracing (depth limiting, early termination)
- Optimize recursive ray tracing (depth limiting, early termination)
- Add space partitioning (octrees or similar) for large scenes
- Optimize OBJ file parsing and mesh loading
- Implement precomputed vertex normals for faster rendering
- Cache transformation matrix inverses
- Test performance on sample scenes (teapot.obj, simple spheres)
- Compare performance metrics before/after optimizations
- Ensure implementation matches book reference for correctness
